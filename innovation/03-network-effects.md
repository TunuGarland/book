When a product’s utility is dependent of how many other people are using it you have network effects. Some products, like a social-media network, are completely dependent of network effects. Other products, like the car, are somewhat but not completely dependent of network effects.

> **The less the value created from a technology, not considering network effects, the longer the time to market.**

Many products that are used are in some way dependent of other people. It might be that the product is used for booking a tennis partner, so other tennis players need to use the product for that to work. Network effects. Any time a product’s usefulness is dependent of how many other people are using it you have network effects.

It takes time for network effects to emerge, because they require a lot of people. But once they are there they are quite hard to compete with, because the benefit from changing is only apparent if people switch, which they are not going to do since the usefulness of changing is quite low as long as few people are there.

This is the good ol’ hen-and-egg problem. The way to solve the problem is by being useful to the people who come first in some way that is not dependent of network effects. The network effects are unlocked later in the process, when adoption of a technology is high. It is a bait-and-switch. If the value is zero without network effects, the product is not going to be adopted, and the value including network effects will never emerge.

The greatest example of this is Amazon. When Amazon first started, they were like a typical book store but online. If you wanted to buy a book, if Amazon carried that in their inventory, you could buy it. Amazon, just like any other book store, had to figure out which items to carry as to fulfill their customers’ needs. They could make sure, though, that they provided something that people wanted - cheap books sent to their door, because they decided what inventory to carry.

But now that there are a lot of people who use Amazon, they don’t do that anymore. They let third-party suppliers fill demand. Amazon is only the marketplace for the transaction. This unlocks network effects, because the more customers that are on their platform, the more demand they provide for the suppliers. And for every supplier that comes to Amazon, the more products they add for their customers.

In the process, Amazon has gone from being a low-margin business (selling price-sensitive items online) to a high-margin business (a marketplace for connecting costumers and suppliers). At the same time, they have managed to lock customers and suppliers into their platform. But that is not where they started - they unlocked the network effects once people were already there.
