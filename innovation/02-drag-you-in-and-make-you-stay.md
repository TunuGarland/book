# Drag you in and Make you stay

\*\* Some technologies drag you in

I remember one thing that my music teacher told me early in life: great music has multiple layers. On the one hand, it has the quality of immediate attraction: Listen to it once, and you like it - it drags you in. This is the first layer. But then, once you are in, it makes you stay with it. You can listen to it over and over and find new things - probably other things than those that dragged you in at first. Great music drags you in. Then it makes you stay. There is immediate attraction as well as depth - multiple layers to discover over time.

He was talking about music, but I believe that this is true for all art. A good book should be so enticing that you want to finish it and then read it again. It shouldn’t feel burdensome to get through it the first time. The next time you read it, there are hopefully new things to discover that make you enjoy it even more, which makes you re-read it.

After the social-media successes at the beginning of the 21st century such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and what have you, many founders were building competing social networks. Social network are interesting because they have no value when no people are on it. It lacks immediate attraction, but it has depth, in the sense that if everyone were magically using it, it would be very useful since everyone is there. But since everyone is already on Facebook, it has already achieved this depth, so no one is going to leave. So how can a social network drag you in?

The adage of the times became that to compete with a social network, there has to be something else that provides value to users that is not dependent on network effects. Figure out a subset of people with something in common. It could be a hobby, an interest or a sport. Then, build something tailor-made for that group. The recipe became to build features solving a particular need for people that could was there without the network effects. It might be a better booking system, a better way to showcase something, or a way to get some information that you want for your particular interest. This is giving people a reason to come, dragging them in. Once people are there, they stay for the network effects. Use the single-player game to make people come. Use the multi-player game to make people stay.

For social networks, this mostly turned out not to work. I believe that this is because a social network tends to not be as useful when confined to one particular part of your life, such as a hobby. It is convenient for people to have one network where they can communicate with all or most people that they want to communicate with, so there is gravitation back to that, making you stay. People are often willing to give up tailor-made features for this and haphazardly fill all of their feature needs with Facebook instead.

But the startups did get one thing right. They had the drag-you-in. But they didn’t have the make-you-stay. Facebook had that.

While my music teacher’s simple idea had immediate attraction to me because it seemed so applicable, it also had depth because it extended beyond music and can be seen everywhere. It’s funny how some things just stick with you.
