The way to tell a seasoned entrepreneur from a rookie is how secretive they are about their ideas. Seasoned entrepreneurs know that ideas are a dime a dozen, while execution is rare. The rookie hasn't understood this and so believes that the idea, the "secret sauce" should be kept a secret.

Thus seasoned entrepreneurs talk about their ideas quite freely. An idea discussed is more likely to improve. Thus it is often in the intereset of entrepreneurs to talk about ideas. So if you want to change the world, you probably want to get your thinking out there in any way you can, even if it means spilling some secret sauce.

Ideas are important to a startup's success. Having a good idea helps convincing others that it will be a success, which helps building a team and finding investors. But even if you have a great idea it is very unlikely that someone is going to steal it. Even if someone would want to steal it, it is unlikely that the person has what it takes to execute on it.
