The other day I talked about habits and what I believe is a good relationship to them. But the hard part is usually not knowing what to do. Most people have a good idea about what they want to do but have a hard time getting around to the doing.

One hack that has worked for me in terms of the "how" that I highly recommend trying, is a morning habit - being conscious about how I spend the first part of my day in the morning. It sounds simple, but it has been a really good trick for me.

What works for me is doing a few activities that are important for me first thing in the morning. These are activities that are important to me long-term, not items on my todo-list. Then I do those things daily (i.e. not only three times a week, not on weekdays or weekends only, but daily). That doesn't mean that I have to do them every single day, because I don't want to be enslaved to my habits, and sometimes other things in life get in the way. But on any typical day, I stick to my morning habit. It's a good hack for the brain. After waking up, there is no question what is about to happen - the brain knows. A deep habit is automatic.

A morning habit means that I don't have to spend as much time thinking about when I am going to find the time for it. When I try to move my habit, like the few days when I have to get up early in the morning to do something that intervenes, it becomes a big mental noise generator during the entire day of thinking "when am I going to find the time?". I have tried moving my habit before, but I know that it becomes such a drag that I typically just skip that day. The most important part is not the single day, but the habit itself.

Moreover, by pushing things until the evening I am giving life ample opportunity to get in the way. Why are most flights delayed in the evening? Because something unexpected has happened during the day, all the subsequent flights are at risk of delay as a consequence. The first flight of the day is usually on time. By doing my habit first thing in the morning few things can get in the way.

I find that it gives a sense of accomplishment to each day. Crap can happen any day, but at least I know that I have made time for my habit when I got up, and that was after all my most important activity. So a day is never all bad.

Finally, many people are just kind of swept along the forces of life that are acting upon them: Bosses, kids, parents, pets, giving little room for what they actually want to be doing. Why not take that most important activity and move it to the forefront of your life?
