I don't consider myself a conservatist, but I believe that conservatists are crucial for innovation. Conservatists do something important:  They remind everyone about the things that were good about the past.

When someone comes up with a new way of doing things and everyone tries it, there might very well be things that we didn't think of that were good about how things were being done before. There are almost always such things, and they often emerge only when you try something new. The future might sound great, but we should not forget about the things that are good about the present.

It is helpful to have people who are reminding everyone of that. That way, the future can become even better.

There is a big difference between being a conservative and a traditionalist. Tradition means sticking to old things for the sake of oldness. This enforces a static society. A very different way to view old things, which I believe is the viewpoint of conservatism at its best, is to point out the benefits of the old way of doing things, lest they be forgotten. Conservatism plays a constructive part in an adaptive system. A traditionalist wants no change at all.

In his incerto-series, Nassim Nicholas Taleb talks about a property of certain things that he refers to as having the "Lindy-property". The concept is simple: Something is Lindy when its expected future lifetime is determined by how long it has already lived. Which Broadway shows will be running 100 years from now? Those that have already been around for 100 years.

If people have continued to do something for a long time, it is quite likely that the practice serves us. That is what Lindy says. This is probably true in many cases. But I believe we can more specific. One can't help but wonder - what is about something old that makes it beneficial? There must be some property beyond the fact that it is old that makes it so. The old needs to be studied thing by thing, system by system. Something else must be there. Perhaps those beneficial properties can be extracted. By trying to extract them, we understand the world a bit better.

But the traditionalist doesn't want to try at all. By sticking to the old only for the sake of it being old, nothing is learned, improved or understood. The traditionalist society is a static one. And a static society eventually dies, because circumstances eventually change.
